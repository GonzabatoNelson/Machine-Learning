 I am a Biomedical Sciences student currently working towards learning how we could utilize computational tools to advance and scientific research. 
  I am particularly looking towards joining Cancer research as I believe cancer is one of humanity's greatest threats. With the high overlap amongst many cancers, utilizing machine learning tools could prove to be essential in correctly classifying and diagnosing cancer type. This would save many lives, money and time especially in the developing world.
  This is therefore a journey not just for myself but one for the greatest benefit of mankind.
   Thank you for passing by,
    Nelson.
